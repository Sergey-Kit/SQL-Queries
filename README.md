# SQL-Queries
Different approaches on MS SQL.

We have 2 table with **transaction info**:
- Date_transaction
- Id_check
- Id_client
- Count_products
- Sum_payment

And **customer info**:
- Id_client
- Gender
- Age

Tasks with the required query conditions are in the txt file.

Solutions correspond to task numbers.
